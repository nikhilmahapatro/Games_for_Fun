# Games_for_Fun
A playful collection of simple games built for learning, practicing, and pure enjoyment.

Games for Fun is a personal portfolio of small, self-contained games crafted as both an educational playground and a nostalgic escape. The purpose behind this repository is to explore fundamental programming concepts through the medium of game development — applying logic, design thinking, event handling, and user interaction in ways that are creative and engaging.

These games aren’t meant to rival commercial titles. Instead, they focus on clarity, simplicity, and hands-on coding experience — perfect for beginners, hobbyists, or developers looking to revisit core concepts through a fun lens.
